## What's the Trolley Problem?
From [*Wikipedia*: ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) "The trolley problem is a series of thought experiments in ethics, psychology and artificial intelligence involving stylized ethical dilemmas of whether to sacrifice one person to save a larger number. The series usually begins with a scenario in which a runaway tram or trolley is on course to collide with and kill a number of people (traditionally five) down the track, but a driver or bystander can intervene and divert the vehicle to kill just one person on a different track. Then other variations of the runaway vehicle, and analogous life-and-death dilemmas (medical, judicial, etc.) are posed, each containing the option to either do nothing, in which case several people will be killed, or intervene and sacrifice one initially "safe" person to save the others.

Opinions on the ethics of each scenario turn out to be sensitive to details of the story that may seem immaterial to the abstract dilemma. The question of formulating a general principle that can account for the differing judgments arising in different variants of the story was raised in 1967 as part of an analysis of debates on abortion and the doctrine of double effect by the English philosopher Philippa Foot.[1] Later dubbed "the trolley problem" by Judith Jarvis Thomson in a 1976 article that catalyzed a large literature, the subject refers to the meta-problem of why different judgements are arrived at in particular instances."

## What's a Trolley Meme?
The formula is pretty simple really. Start with one of the hgihly exploitable images for the trolley problem or the fat man variant, originally found on Jesse Prinz's site [subcortex](http://subcortex.com/). 
![trolley template](http://subcortex.com/pictures/Trolley_1.jpg)

Then apply some snark and elementary image manipulation skills. The result should roughly approximate this image (which does not *necessarily* describe my own views on anything, except trollley memes as an online cultural phenomenon):

If it still doesn't make sense, you should probably get out of the house more. That said, [Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-trolley-problem#fn1) is a good resource for these things.

## But WTF is THIS Anyway???
### '...first as a tragedy, second as a farce.' 
*—Karl Marx*

If I had the talent or the time to write a song or paint a painting for my final project, I might have. But I don't. So here are some trolley problem memes I dialed up to convey my argument. This project explores the absurdity of modern life dominated by technocracy and bureaucracy. I'm hiding behind bad jokes to mask my own lack of talent and poor time management. Drawing inspiration from Le Guin's "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas," Kafka's *The Trial*, and *In the Penal Colony*, Foucault's *Discipline and Punish*, Bauman's *Modernity and the Holocaust*, and the late great David Graeber's *The Utopia of Rules* (among others), I examine how our blind faith in automated systems and bureaucratic red tape perpetuates injustice and dehumanization. The techno-bureaucratic utopia some of us imagine we inhabit is a cruel joke with a lousy punchline: the child in the basement is us, life ain't fair, and you're going to be dead soon. Enjoy the memes.
